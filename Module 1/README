# Module 1 Assignment

```
This demo simulates a simple authentication system to demonstrate confidentiality in a software application. It includes user login, role-based access control, and protected actions based on user roles.

The confidentiality is protected by the specified roles, leading to special authorization requirements. These are needed to access data, and utilize tools. 

The app uses functions to gather input from the user and verify if/which panel they qualify to see (users or admin).
