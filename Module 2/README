# Encryption Demo (AES + RSA)

This project demonstrates **symmetric (AES)** and **asymmetric (RSA)** encryption/decryption using Pythonâ€™s `cryptography` library.  
Now the program allows the **user to enter their own message** at runtime.

---

## Features
1. **AES (Symmetric Encryption)**
   - A random 256-bit AES key and 128-bit IV are generated.
   - The user-provided plaintext message is encrypted using AES in CFB mode.
   - The ciphertext is decrypted back to plaintext using the same key/IV.

2. **RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)**
   - A 2048-bit RSA private/public key pair is generated.
   - The user-provided plaintext message is encrypted using the public key and OAEP padding.
   - The ciphertext is decrypted using the private key.

## Running the Script
```bash
pip install cryptography
python crypto_demo.py
